To-Do App :- 

I developed a To-Do App using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, designed to help users organize and manage tasks effectively. The app features a responsive user interface where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. React's component-based architecture and state management using hooks like useState enable dynamic updates and a seamless user experience. The project showcases my ability to build functional and interactive web applications, demonstrating strong front-end development skills and an understanding of modern JavaScript frameworks.
